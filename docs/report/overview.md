## Project Description

In the context of the FVM Early Builder program (Solidity edition), we proposee to build a set of tools and libraries to enable Ethereum developers to re-use their existing know-how to develop Filecoin-specific use cases.

The first goal, which we have defined as Milestone 1 consisted of a feasibility analysis to evaluate if it is worth it to serialise and deserialize data in solidity.
